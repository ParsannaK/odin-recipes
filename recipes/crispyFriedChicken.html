                making it too tough. Also, it helps the flour mixture stick to the chicken.

            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>2 cups all-purpose Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour gives the buttermilk and seasoning something <br>
                to stick to, while ensuring a wonderfully crispy crust.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Seasoning:</strong> A blend of salt, pepper, 1 tsp paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder <br>
