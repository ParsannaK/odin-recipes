    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Golden Butter Rice is a simple and delicious rice dish that goes 
        well with a variety of main courses. It is easy to make and is a great 
        way to add some flavor to your meal.

        This golden butter rice, flavored with ginger and turmeric, is a forgotten
        way of cooking butter rice. It isn't cooked rice with butter stirred in, it 
        really is rice cooked in butter. This is my favorite version, with seasonings 
        inspired by a classic Indian drink called golden milk.
