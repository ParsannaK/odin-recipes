        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Golden Butter Rice is a simple and delicious rice dish that goes 
            well with a variety of main courses. <br> It is easy to make and is a great 
            way to add some flavor to your meal.
        </p>
        <p>
            This golden butter rice, flavored with ginger and turmeric, is a forgotten
            way of cooking butter rice. <br> It isn't cooked rice with butter stirred in, it 
            really is rice cooked in butter. <br> This is my favorite version, with seasonings 
            inspired by a classic Indian drink called golden milk.
